This malware file is from a pcap analysis provided by https://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/06/22/index.html . My writeup on the pcap is available here: https://github.com/Jon1090/pcap_analysis/blob/main/2019-06-22%20traffic%20analysis/2019-06-22-traffic-analysis-exercise
The file name is: 2019-06-22-malware-retrieved-from-the-infected-windows-host.exe

While we confirmed from our pcap alerts and search that this file is Kpot stealer, how could it quickly be identified if it were attached in an email or otherwise with a benign file name? I will take a look at the sample in 
REMnux and point out some common warning signs.

The most obvious step is to hash the file and search for it on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis. These two immediately flag the sample as malware. The SHA256 sum for the file is: 39be5610259ffade85599720ee0af31187788a00791f1e4cb0cd05ef00105eda
We can see that this file reaches out to the domain fghjkmgru34.site as shown in our pcap. How could we check for ourselves and verify that this is malware?

Unfortunately, my clamscan (up to date as of 7/2/23) doesn't detect this as a malicious file. I used pe-tree to get a look at the overall entropy and metadata about the file. The entropy is 6.3 which is high, and the .text and
.rsrc are 6.4 and 6.5 respectively. This is a clue that this malware sample is highly encoded. It does not appear to be using a packer. The e_magic is 0x5a4d, a windows executable and the architecture is I386, 32-bit. The point
of entry is 0x00017a70 which corresponds to .text, as expected. The major operating system is windows vista/windows server 2008. There are five sections: .text, .rdata, .data, .rsrc, .reloc. 

The dll's and api calls can be seen by searching the strings or by looking through pe-tree, pecheck, or other tools. Some suspicious calls divided into sections are as follows:

VM detection/analysis detection (big indication of malware): GetDiskFreeSpaceA, GetDriveTypeW, GetSystemInfo, IsDebuggerPresent, FindNextFileA, Sleep, User32,GetCursorPos, NetWkstaGetInfo, PathFileExists, TerminateProcess

Registry Editing: RegSetValueExW, RegQueryValueExW, RegOpenKeyExW, RegCloseKey, RegCreateKeyExW

Hollowing/CodeInjection (big indication of malware): VirtualAlloc, CreateThread

Viewing and editing your information and files: ReadFile, WriteFile, OpenClipboard, CloseClipboardM, GetClipboardData

Registry editing: RegSetValueExW, RegQueryValueExW, RegOpenKeyExW, RegCloseKey, RegCreateKeyExW

Even without the confirmation from Virus Total, we can conclude on our own that this is certainly a suspicious file. To find out what this malware really does, it will likely need to be inspected with dynamic analysis. If the 
anti-debugger features keep it from showing its true colors, the next step will be reverse engineering.
